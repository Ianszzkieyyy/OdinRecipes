    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Lasagna with sausage, mushrooms, and lots of cheese is fast and 
        easy on the stove top--and there's no compromise on flavor.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Lasagna noodles</li>
            <li>Marinara sauce</li>
            <li>Bulk Italian sausage or ground beef</li>
            <li>Ricotta, Mozzarella, and Parmigiano-Reggiano</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees Fahrenheit.</li>
            <li>Cook the noodles in boiling water for 4 minutes and drain with a colander. Run it through cold water to stop from further cooking. Set aside.</li>
            <li>In a large saucepan, mix sausage or ground beef and 1 1/12 of the marinara sauce. Let it simmer for 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>In a separate bowl, mix Ricotta, 3 1/2 cups of mozzarella, Parmigiano-Reggiano, and eggs.</li>
            <li>Grease a lasagna pan or a 9Ã—13-inch baking dish with cooking spray.</li>
            <li>Spread a thin layer of the marinara sauce over the baking dish, about 3/4 cup. Layer 3 to 5 lasagna noodles over the sauce. The noodles should only overlap slightly with each other.<br>Layer the cheese mixture of the noodles, followed by the meat sauce.
            </li>
            <li>Repeat the layers starting from the noodles to the meat sauce twice. Top the meat sauce with the remaining marinara sauce and sprinkle with the remaining mozzarella cheese.</li>
            <li>Cover the baking dish with foil and bake for 30 minutes. Remove the foil and cook for an additional 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Let the lasagna sit for 10 minutes before slicing and serving. Enjoy!</li>
